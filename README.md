# vue-pomodoro

> Another pomodoro clock with to-do list, built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a time management technique used to break down work into intervals. 

## Making use of this application

Using the underlying principles of the Pomodoro Technique:

1. Add a task to the list on the right side

2. Start the timer

3. Work on the task

4. End work when the timer is complete, this is one "pomodoro" finished

5. If you have less than 4 pomodoros take a short break (3-5 minutes), then restart the timer

6. If you do have 4 pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes), then restart the timer


As tasks are completed mark them on the right side to keep track.
